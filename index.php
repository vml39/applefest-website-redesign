      <h1>ABOUT</h1>
      <p>The annual Apple Harvest Festival, presented by the Tompkins Trust Company, features dozens of vendors, from craft artists to farmers, celebrating the local diversity in the Upstate New York region. The festival is held every year in the Ithaca Commons in the first weekend of October, and is a three-day long festival featuring games, performances, and a lot of food. Kettle corn, maple syrup, apple cider, fudge, and apple cider donuts are among the treats you'll see at the festival. The vendors are all excited to share their craft with you, whether it be the food they grow, or the art they make, and we can't wait to see you there as well! </p><br/><br/>
